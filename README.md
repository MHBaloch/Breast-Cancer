# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis
Task: 
Binary classification for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

Approach:
The task is performed on breast cancer dataset from sklearn datasets.
Support vector machine algorithm is used for the binary classsifcation
with the kernel set to linear. The SVC has been known as an effective 
binary classifier. The results are determined with cross-validation,
auc-roc and confusion matrix to determine the classification results.

Result:
False prediction rate is less than 5%.
